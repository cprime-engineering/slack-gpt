Business Owners


Business Owners are a small group of stakeholders who have the primary business and 
technical responsibility for governance, compliance, and return on investment (ROI) for a 
Solution developed by an Agile Release Train (ART). They are key stakeholders on the ART who 
must evaluate fitness for use and actively participate in certain ART events. The continuous 
involvement of the Business Owners throughout the PI serves as an important Guardrail to the 
budgetary spend of the ART.

Guide for the Assignment of Business 
Value

Business Value for quarterly objectives is the Business OwnerÕs (AKA Product Manager) 
perception on a scale of one to 10 of the business value a teamÕs quarterly objective delivers. 
Business value is assigned using a linear scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being high and 1 low. 
Assignment of business value serves two purposes:
1)	Helps the team understand priorities, team quarterly objectives with higher business 
value should be worked on first
2)	Creates alignment between the business owner and the team. The assignment of 
business value should be a conversation between the team and the business owner. 

There are few guides for the assignment of business value because it is completely based on 
the BOÕs perception. This can put much pressure on the BO and also can lead to situations 
where the business value does not serve its purpose of prioritization and alignment of 
expectations. 
How Many Quarterly Objectives?
Generally, a team should create 3 to 5 PI objectives. Too many team quarterly objectives could 
suggest the team lacks focus, less than 3 suggests the team may be Òputting all their eggs in 
one basket.Ó
Multiple Business Owners
If there are multiple business owners, they still assign only one business value to a business 
objective. The Business owners must talk among themselves and come to an agreement. 
Guidelines for Assigning Business Value
The suggestions made here for determining the assignment of business value is just 
thatÉsuggestions. These are arbitrary defaults. Before quarterly planning, we suggest the 
Program Manager or coach take the opportunity to sit down with the business owner and work 
out a guide for assignment business value.

10-8 direct 
impact
These objectives have direct market impact either increase market share, 
defend market share, or delight customers. Both customer facing objectives 
and enablers can fall into this category. For example, fixing a security 
defect that has resulted in negative press could have high business value. 
Also the team may be working on an enabler for a high value feature.
Generally a team should have only one 10 top value feature at most. 

These are outcomes that cannot Òfall off the tableÓ if the team gets 
overwhelmed

6-8 Indirect high 
impact
Ongoing enhancements to features and the system itself. Feature may not 
have immediate impact or visibility but will contribute value. Over the long 
run this is stuff we should be doing for either it will seem out of date from 
our customer point of view or technical debt will accumulate and reduce our 
velocity. 


4-6 Stuff we 
should do
Similar to 6 and 8 but the connection to value is less impactful
1-4 why are we 
doing this?
This range indicates the BO sees very low value in these objectives. Low 
values should spark a conversation between the team and the BO if there 
are differing perception on the value of an objective. These are objectives 
that may Òfall off the tableÓ if push comes to shove with team capacity and 
other higher value objectives. 


The following is an example of a guide created by Dave Cornelius for a Forbes article

program-increment-objectives/?sh=17a144022523

1.	(Low) Resolve a low-priority customer request
2.	Deliver MVP to validate customer interest or market viability

Business Owners Play the Key Governance Role for an ART
A key governance function the Business Owners perform is the draft plan and final plan reviews 
during PI planning. While product management and product owners prioritize the backlogs, 
they do so in service to the needs of the enterprise (expressed by the strategic themes,  vision 
and Epics). The Business Owners are the ones writing the checks so to speak and therefore 
need to know what is being done with the money. During PI planning they want verify if the 
solution(s) delivered by the ART will be fit for purpose and if they can trust the plans the teams 
are presenting to them. 

PI Planning and the Business Owner (BO)
The whole point of PI Planning is for the Team to create and  present a credible and defensible 
plan to the Business Owner. The plan should clearly express to the business owner what value 
the team will deliver during the PI and to provide evidence the plan is credible. In simple terms 
the BO needs to three questions
1)	Do I clearly understand what the team plans to deliver during the PI (both to run the 
business and grow the business)
2)	Is the team delivering the right things?
3)	Why should I believe them?
Guidelines for Reviewing the PI Plans
Do I know what I am getting for my money? 
These two items simply check the BO understand what is being delivered and that it is aligned 
to an outcome the BO is accountable for. As a BO, simply ask, do I really know what I am getting 
and what I will see at the PI system demo?

PI Objectives are written such that they are clearly understood by the BO
PI objectives are a summary of a teamÕs business and technical goals for a PI and  
communicates to a business owner what they plan to do. While SAFe recommends 
writing PI objectives as SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-
bound), we offer simpler advice, what does the BO need to hear from the team to 
clearly understand the value the team plans to deliver during the PI. 

PI Objectives are aligned to an outcome that important to the BO
The NWS vision is driven by our V2MOMs, FSA, Service Offerings and Run the Business 
(RTB) work. A PI objective should express some outcome that moves us closer to that 
vision. It is not enough to have a PI outcome such as Òdeliver configuration scriptÓ rather 
Òreduce set up time and improve setup accuracy by automating configuration process 
with configuration scriptÓ   This may seem a subtle difference, but it is important to  
demonstrate the objective is aligned to an outcome that is important to the BO

Why Should I Believe this Plan?
The plan is not a wild aspiration, it is intended to be a commitment. These checks verify there is 
sufficient supporting evidence for the plan to be credible and not just wishful thinking.

Capacity is supported by data
The Team capacity is total capacity for work the team has during the PI. For an existing 
team the best data is the teamÕs historical velocity. For example if  a team has an 
average historic velocity of 100 points per PI then the  teamÕs capacity should be 100 
points.  For a newly formed team or a team that has had a significant personal change, 
then they can use the SAFe normalized point calculation. Either way, the team should 
clearly express how they calculated their capacity for the upcoming PI.

Load takes into account historic  reality
Load is how much work a team has actually planned into their PI. For each iteration in 
the PI, It is the sum of the story points that a team has allocated to each sprint. Rules for 
judging the load:
1)	The load must never exceed the team capacity. My personal guideline is the load 
should never exceed 80% of capacity. 
2)	The load takes into account historic operations work. That is if a team has 50% 
operations responsibility then that team should only load themselves to half of 
their available capacity. Make sure to ask the team, historically what % of their 
work is ÒexpectedÓ but unplanned work. 

Dependencies Are Identified and commitments accepted
Unless the team lives in a bubble the team will have dependencies on other teams or 
individuals. Even for teams that do not depend on another team to create an artifact for 
them there are often dependencies on approvers and other decision makers. For this 
team to make an honest commitment to you, they will need a commitment from those 
that they depend on, that they can actually deliver on the dependency as planned. 


Team risks are identified and ROAMed
A team cannot make an honest commitment without knowing the risks. Risks are 
threats to the team delivering on the PI objectives. Risk can include dependencies on 
others that have not been resolved. For example, delivery on a PI objective depends on 
an approval by an individual who has not committed a date for their decision. For the 
draft plan risks should at least be identified. For the final plan, the risks should be 
ROAMed. 

There will be some risks the team cannot handle on their own and those should be put 
onto the program risk board.
